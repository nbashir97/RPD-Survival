### Background
These R and Stata code were used to analyse NHANES III, combined with the 2019 linked mortality data, in order to assess the effect of removable partial dentures on survival in partially dentate adults. The findings were published in the Journal of Dentistry.

### Abstract
**Objectives:** The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the use of removable partial dentures (RPDs) has an effect on long-term survival outcomes amongst partially edentulous adults. \
**Methods:** Data were extracted from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked to public-use mortality files for the period up to 2019. Partially edentulous adults with fewer than 20 teeth were included. RPD use and dentition status were determined by clinical examination. The cohort was propensity score weighted to create a sample which was balanced across 27 covariates (sociodemographics, health behaviors and insurance, laboratory markers, and general health status). Survival analysis was undertaken to compute absolute (mortality rate and median survival time) and relative (event time ratio [ETR]) measures of exposure effect. \
**Results:** The analyzed cohort included 1246 participants, which equated to 22,557 person-years of follow-up. The difference in all-cause mortality rate between RPD wearers and non-wearers was found to be –6.5 (95% CI: –11.6 to –1.4), with the median survival time in RPD wearers being 3.1 years longer (20.3 years versus 17.2 years). A 26% increase in survival time was observed in RPD wearers (ETR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.37) and it was found that, for every 7.5 individuals treated with RPDs, one death would be prevented after 10 years of treatment. \
**Conclusions:** The use of RPDs may have long-term benefits in reducing mortality amongst adults with a non-functional dentition, but further research is needed to validate these findings and assess the factors mediating the relationship.

### Analysis
The Stata do-files were run in the order numbered. The R files were run after the corresponding number do-file, note that the R files contain the script necessary for the main and sensitivity analyses.
